### COUPLED ELECTRONS WITH A D=1 SPIN CHAIN

We study theoretically the interaction between a domain wall (DW) and electrons in a D=1 spatial dimension, from a microscopic perspective. We model the magnetic domain wall with a Heisenberg configurated classical spin chain of N spin with uniaxial anisotropy, coupled with a tigh-binding chain of electrons via s-d exchange interaction. We obtain the dynamical equations of the system and we solve them proposing a self-consisteng approach.

#### Methodology

We set up the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the tigh-binding Hamiltonian and the s-d exchange interaction Hamiltonian. 

We derive the dynamic equations for each of the aligned spins from the spin chain, obtaining the Lagrangian and then, using the Euler-Lagrange equation.

The self-consistent problem utilizes the time independent Schrodinger equation (which reduces to a eigenvalues problem), it casts the wave functions needed to solve the non-linear system of equations for spins.

Solving these equations will give the solution for the static case (time derivative matched to zero). The solution consists on an array of spins, a new configuration for the chain. This new set of spin is now given to the eigenvalue problem to solve, and the cycle repeats again, until the loop converges to a stable solution for the system.
